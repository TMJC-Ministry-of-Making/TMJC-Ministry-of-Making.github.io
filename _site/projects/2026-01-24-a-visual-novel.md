# motivation

A visual novel combines the arts and coding sides of Maker's club, and allows us to get creative through storytelling while learning new skills.

# main goal

To create a completed visual novel game with original art, writing, and hopefully soundtrack.

# starting progress

We didn't have much of a basis for the storyline at first aside from making it school-related, so we mostly just threw out random genres and tried to come up with something based on them. This resulted in a lot of funny drafts, like one where the school mascot was a horror entity. We eventually settled on fantasy as our main theme.

# challenges

It was a struggle to put together a coherent plot at first. There were many plotholes and inconsistencies that made it difficult to continue writing. There's also the struggle of members juggling different responsibilities aside from this project, including competitions and studies.

# improvements

After several sessions, we finally came up with a general plotline that made sense. We simplified the story to remove the plotholes and inconsistencies so that our plot would flow well. Despite our uncoordinated schedules, we managed to write parts of the script for the story.
